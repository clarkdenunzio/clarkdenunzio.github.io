Wouldn't it be nice if we could have all the answers just handed to us and explained in plain English? I would think so too, except, unless you're a rockstar singer or beautiful model with a team of managers and agents, then that's probably not going to happen. Therefore, it's important to note that the ability to sift through large bulks of information and find the one piece that is actually relevant to your case, is indeed the heart of hacking.
Luckily for us, we have the internet at our disposal that let's us steal from the souls of an innumberable number of intellectuals that have since entered and gone from this world. With a diligent mind one can teach themselves almost any skill imaginable from the gurus of the net. It is a scary yet powerful thing, and it is time to start using that power for yourself sooner rather than later.

Let us reflect on the following question from the ever-popular [Stack Overflow](stackoverflow.com/) and try to see why this asker was so effective at solving his problem.

<hr>

[The question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13099069/apache-basic-authentication-issue-with-reverse-proxy) I have chosen details a novice programmer running into a common, yet forgiveable flaw in his or her code. Let us dig a little deeper and see why this was helpful enough, that another commenter felt the need to chime in a "Thank You" two years after the solution was posted.

-Full Disclosure: The author made it easy for the community by posting his full logs of his code, operating system, and versions! Anyone who is also working with these techonolgies can easily relate to this case now. As we can see, it was a rookie mistake that involved conflicting firewalls but because of the approach of asking, it was easily forgiven and corrected.

-DIY Attempts: The author mentioned he had already debugged his Apache code to the point where he knew it was not a username error nor a password error. The author posted the logs that appeared when a username/password error was forced, and that is how he knew it could not be either of those problems. By narrowing down the problem for the community, it was more favorably for someone to get some easy upvotes by helping a rookie out real quick. In the end, a poster pointed out what the syntax of the log meant, and how "mismatch" meant his OAuth firewalls were conflicting rather than username/password.

Moving on, some questions may seem fun or relevant to discuss however no true value is being gained from such questions as they are more of a philosophical dialogue rather than true question.

I have chosen the [following question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30271988/jquery-vs-new-javascript-frameworks-libraries-angular-ember-react-etc/33315002), and let us once again examine a couple points about why this question might be considered a waste of time by the community. 

-Moot Point: This question was actually closed by an admin for this exact reason. Not to steal the words of the admin, but questions like this may spark an interesting debate but truly no one is gaining a solution like this. It is more like an ongoing debate, and it seems as if the original poster is already very unsure of the topic and will likely change their mind in the future either way.

-Generic: The author is generalizing almost all Javascript frameworks in their quest of the perfect framework when in reality they all were invented to be smaller pieces of a larger ecosystem. Unless of course we are bringing up Angular, Angular is MASSIVE, perhaps an ecosystem in it's own right, wink-wink. Truthfully though, this research could easily be done by the author. As the guide to asking smart questions states, this is quite frankly a STFW case.

I hope this was enlightening, thanks for reading. If you have been reading my other essay then you will know that I was once this person on the wrong side of asking smart questions. That is normal, if that is you too, don't panic. I survived, and so will you.
