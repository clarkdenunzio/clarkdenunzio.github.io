## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
Have been to the Gym at UH Manoa and it took you an hour and forty-five minutes to complete your thirty minute routine...
The gym at UH is undoubtedly a great facility and it is a great, additional resource for students that pay their activity's fee. However, because of traffic, campus can get crowded around certain times of the day like the lunch hour and particularly at the gym around 3 p.m. when most students finish class. This leads to crowding and it can be hard to use the equipment you want in time efficiently.

## Mockup page ideas
Students can login and approve the app to access their class schedule. Their can be a schedule screen where students can pick workouts for certain days. Another tab could include a Log so students can track their progress on certain excercise such as the weight they are lifting on that

## Use case ideas
This app will sync UH users schedules that identify that they use the Gym and recommend an optimal time to go to avoid the rush.
