# AvaLunch at University of Hawaii: Manoa

Welcome to AvaLunch, this project was completed by three team members over the course of 30 days.

Please view our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/avalunch) to learn more about the team members.

All source code for our project can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/Avalunch/Avalunch).

Or, please, take our guided walkthrough [here](https://avalunch.github.io).

## AvaLunch in a nutshell

AvaLunch analyzes current food preferences and favorites with respect to the student currently logged-in, and helps students navigate the campus with an interactive SVG-mapped menu on top of a data-driven backend to improve recommendations.


AvaLunch helps  students evaluate the sometimes overwhelming number of food choices and the varying properties of the meals they are seeking for proper nutrition, and determine ways to invest their time most productively during what may be a short lunch break period.

AvaLunch also helps students by providing data-backed evidence regarding the favorites, previously-tweeted, and other new recommendations based on browsing and shopping history.

## My Role In AvaLunch

For AvaLunch, I assumed the role of backend architect as the vision for this project was largely data-driven and would not be possible without a strong data model put in place behind the scenes. During the first milestone, I was coaching my team members about the importance of a data-model, and drew almost double-digits UML maps to help guide my teammates. During the second milestone, I implemented the entire backend services for our team, adding two scalable MongoDB collections that could be queried against to achieve full functionality for our application. During the third milestone, I worked with my backend services to adjust what was there, and what should be there. A profile page was implemented where users can change their data for new queries, leading to new recommendations.

## After Thoughts

I learned substantially about "team-play" in the coding world, coming from a background of pure "solo-play". Although, I am preferential to working alone, I was delighted to coach my teammates through their troubles. In addition, I added substantially to my skill-set as a data scientist, and solutions architect with my new working knowledge of MongoDB and UML mapping. Although, project management was a struggle at times, our team performed very honorably throughout the 30 days.
