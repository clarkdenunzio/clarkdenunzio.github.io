<h4>Motivation:</h4>

DeNunzio Web Studios was started in October, 2016 after it became clear that despite numerous personal setbacks, the technology we are learning can be wielded powerfully. 
This experience has helped me learn how to devise strategies using technology to accomplish business goals, and to make tough decisions that will inevitably involve money.

<h4>Relevance:</h4>

[Woocommerce](http://woocommerce.com) was selected as my e-commerce platform as a plugin on the popular [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) platform, of which I was already familiar. 
With the addition of RESTful JSON APIs as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) and [Woocommerce](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/) plugins, these technologies became a prime choice.

During this experience, I spent hands-on time with full-stack web application design and associated technologies, including the LAMP Stack on [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), the [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) CSS Framework for the user interface, and [npm](http://npmjs.com) for using frameworks like React and Hexo.
