It would be easy to assume that it's boring to watch someone else play a video game, and that is what I thought too before I started watching [Twitch TV](http://twitch.tv/). In fact, I found it to be one of the most entertaining ways to hone skills at sometimes frustrating multiplayer games.

The step up from a causal gamer to an elite power gamer can be intimidating, and that is why many people have found a haven on Twitch TV where they can see new strategies being implemented without risking their ranks to test them out.

<img class="ui small left floated image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/slark.jpg"> What games have I played do you ask?
I began my entry into streaming as a DOTA 2 fan. A popular spinoff named League of Legends had just claimed a massive userbase and I was eager to see what all of the hype was about.
After many unsuccessful stints, in other games, I found my true passion to be for DOTA 2 as always. Above you can see one of my favorite characters, Slark.

<img class="ui small right floated image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}//images/creative.jpg"> As many of us have guessed, it's hard to be an engineer and a gamer at the same time, and unfortunately I've had to retire from streaming temporarily.
However, I am considering a relaunch of my stream under a new banner with the addition of the new [Creative Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Creative) on Twitch TV. Many other web developers offer a sneak peek into their work flow on Twitch, and with my newfound programming skills, I think it will be a great way to combine by old passion with my new passion.
